        "question": [
            ["Can you tell me a little about yourself?",
                "I'm a product designer based in San Franscisco. I've spent the last 3 years working with the wonderful design team Square, where I've been mainly focused on building out a consistent and scalable design system for their growing team. Prior to that, I spent 2 years with Coda as a user researcher and UI designer. I really enjoyed the visual design and interaction design aspects of this role. I actually have a background in architecture and hold a Masters of Architecture from the University of Melbourne. I've always been passionate about design and became fascinated with product design and UX back in 2015 because of its focus on data and user research to make the best design decisions and user experience. I found this data-led design process fascinating. I spent a year learning all I can about the product design process in my spare time before transitioning into the industry."], 
            ["What is your design process?", 
                "Of course, this depends largely on the project, timeframe, and requirements, but my ideal design process is as follows. I like to think about the product design process as problem-solving. The first step of this process is to understand the problem through research: user research, stakeholder interviews, competitive audits, user personas, market research... The goal here is to develop a deep understanding of what the problem is, what the business goals are, and what success looks like. I like to establish clear KPIs and success metrics at this point. I also like to involve the engineering team and other stakeholders in the design process as early as possible. This helps me better understand constraints or other perspectives that are invaluable and help prevent roadblocks down the track! Once I have a well-rounded understanding of everything, I'll begin wireframing and prototyping potential solutions. This is a highly interactive process. If the project and timeframe allow, it's always a good idea to conduct some usability testing at this point where I like to conduct further user research with interactive Figma prototypes to highlight areas of improvement. When the development process starts, I'll continue to work closely with the engineering team to make sure they have everything they need (mockups, user flows etc.). Finally, once the design is live, I'll keep a close eye on both quantitative and quantitative data and compare it against the KPIs I set at the start of the project. This helps identify areas we can improve further. Usually, this involves ongoing usability testing and A/B testing so we can further iterate and improve the user experience."],
            ["What type of work or part of the design process do you enjoy the most?", 
                "I gravitate much more towards the prototyping and UI design stage of the design process. Building complex user flows and iterating on them are where my strengths are and I really enjoy using Figma and Principle. That being said, I understand that this is just a small part of the design process so I try not to neglect the research and testing parts of the process!"],
            ["What type of work or part of the design process do you not enjoy doing?", 
            "Numbers and analyzing large data sets are something that I've had a bit of trouble with in the past. When I worked for Doordash, I conducted some large-scale usability testing which involved a lot of data. The goal was to quantify areas we can improve in the iOS app sign-up process and begin working on some improved designs. At the time, I hadn't had much experience with working with data sets of that size and found it challenging. With the help of an online course from Udemy, I was able to work my way through it and uncover some useful insights. We made improvements based on these insights and saw a 10% decrease in sign-up dropoffs over the next month! This is still the part of the UX process I find challenging, so I've been continuing with Udemy courses in my spare time to improve since then."],
            ["What is the difference between product design and UX design or UI design?", 
            "I like to think of product design as the entire process that involves UX, UI and other aspects of the design process. UX design is focused on investigating behavioral patterns and exploring how to improve the user experience, while UI design is focused on implementing these learnings into a user interface and experience. Product design is both of these processes and more. As a product designer, my focus is on the entire user experience holistically. This includes constantly making improvements to the current user experience, even if I didn't design it. A great product designer should be able to handle the entire design process end-to-end, and then continue to iterate on the final product over time to improve it."],
            ["How do you know if you've made the correct design decision?", 
            "Data, mainly! When working on a new feature or product, it's just as important to test ideas before they're built as it is to test them after. While common sense and even a bit of intuition are useful, the key part of the design process is data and user testing which should inform decisions. When I was a product designer at Coinbase, we weren't sure how to layout a table on mobile. This was a central part of the product and everyone had a different opinion on how it should be done. After we had a few prototypes ready in Figma, we conducted some usability testing with Maze and collected qualitative and quantitative data on which our users performed. There was a clear preference for the new table layout. This was just a small sample size and an interactive prototype, but enough validation that we were on the right track. After it was built and live on the site, we defined some key metrics to monitor and set up some larger usability tests to make sure it was the right decision. The result was that the majority of users preferred the new design. Our analytics showed that more users were interacting with the table on mobile as well. Of course, we expected this, but we couldn't have been sure it was the correct design decision until we'd thoroughly tested the idea."],
            ["How do you handle design criticism?", 
            "I like to leave my ego out of the room when it comes to product design; I think great product designers are objective and should rely on data. Once you get emotional about a design decision or criticism it just complicates things and makes everyone's job harder. This leads to a worse-off user experience in the long run. If I'm presenting ideas or prototypes and they're met with design criticism I always handle it professionally and patiently. I think it's best to make design decisions based on data and user testing to keep things objective so that's often the best approach — I can then incorporate this feedback into the next iteration. If the criticism is subjective (e.g. I do not like that color), I like to understand why they don't like it and whether there are other options we can look at that don't sacrifice contrast and usability or other important details. Of course, there always needs to be room for compromise if necessary. This can be a balancing act between understanding the business goals, time and resource constraints, and what the user testing and data shows. At the end of the day, as long as I can keep everyone happy and make the best design decisions possible with the information available I am happy."],
            ["Do you have any experience with design systems?", 
            "Yes — I helped build and maintain the Figma design system at Wealthsimple. We used Storybook to keep everything consistent and up-to-date which made our frontend developers' lives much easier! I think consistency and scalability are important, especially at the start of new products. Without a proper design system to work from and build upon, maintaining consistent designs and remembering design decisions just becomes a mess. Over time, this builds expensive technical debt that will eventually have to be sorted out."],
            ["Why do you want this product design job?", 
            "Stripe has a fantastic reputation. I have a few former colleagues working here, and I've seen how much Stripe's mission to increase the GDP of the Internet bleeds into everything you do. I helped Bolt design its one-click checkout, and I believe I could contribute significantly to the design and improvement of Stripe Checkout."],
            ["Do you have a project that you're most proud of?", 
            "When I was a UX designer at Stash, I worked on the new onboarding process. This was my first project at Stash that I handled on my own end-to-end. I had one main goal: to improve the signup conversion rate which had been hovering at 30-32% for the last two quarters. I researched dozens of similar experiences and best practices, spoke to existing users, designed new experiences in Figma, and even built working prototypes in Webflow before conducting a series of user tests to make the best design decisions. Once the new onboarding was live, I tracked conversions and we saw a significant uptick. The conversion rate increased to 45% and I used Hotjar to make incremental improvements for the following quarter. After 3 months, the conversion rate was 56%."],
            ["Have you had any projects that didn't go well?", 
            "Absolutely! In 2020, I was working on a small design team at Customer.io. We were working on improving the text editor as it was outdated and users were experiencing some formatting issues in certain browsers. The goal was to update the design of the text editor to match our new design as well as fix these formatting issues. It was my responsibility to prototye a new design in Figma. We presented the new design to our product manager and she loved it. However, once it was implemented, we spoke to some of our users and they were frustrated that the formatting panel was fixed to the top of the text box. This became an issue when you are working with a lot of text because you have to scroll back up. We didn't foresee this problem during the design process. To fix this, we had to work quickly and implement a fix to make this formating panel sticky for longer text boxes. As part of the design process, we spent a lot of time looking at what competitors and great companies were doing. However, these solutions weren't working with large bodies of text like some of our customers were. If I was to do this project over again, I would have more carefully thought through these fringe cases and conducted some usability testing with a working prototype. This would have undoubtedly uncovered this problem before it was pushed live."],
            ["What is your favorite product?", 
            "My favorite product is the Robinhood platform. It's an investment app that allows you to buy shares and options. I started using this app initially for its features as it allows you to purchase fractional shares which are partial amounts of shares. Both the design and UX of the app have won me over since then. I've used a bunch of brokerage platforms in the past, but Robinhood has really stepped up from a product design perspective. One thing they do really great is that the app is designed intuitively on both desktop and mobile. Most alternatives I explored neglected the desktop experience. It's incredibly easy to navigate and search. The team behind the app creates some really great educational content mainly aimed at helping new investors get comfortable with investing. The difference between Robinhood and other investing apps is that all of this great content and info is accessible right in the app. It's always encouraging me to explore new companies and learn about them. I've seen firsthand how well their UX works at keeping me engaged. So much so that I'm constantly referring to it as I tackle similar design challenges. One thing I think that lets the Robinhood user experience down is their onboarding. It's very long because financial services apps need a lot of information for risk and compliance reasons, however, there's no indication of how far along in the process you are. As a result, it's tempting to drop out and finish it later but you cannot dave your progress. This is one of the first things I'd fix if I was working on this product to avoid potential customers dropping out of the signup process."],
            ["How do you use user personas?", 
            "I use my user personas throughout the entire product design process, especially at the beginning and end of each step. I found this strategy to be useful in my previous product design position because it allowed me to make sure the product was addressing consumer needs at all production points. For example, I was designing a carpet cleaner and designed the product with a built-in brush on the bottle to allow consumers to remove stains using only the bottle. I did this because a consumer challenge I found in my initial persona research was that consumers weren't able to get to stains fast enough with the number of materials they needed to grab."],
            ["How do you approach making user personas?", 
            "When making user personas, I usually begin by gathering consumer data to understand who the product's target audiences are. To find this information, I search through the internal data my company has, as well as external consumer data online. Once I have this insight, I develop between four and six personas to represent different target audience groups. In each of them, I try to highlight information like demographic, personality, preferred channels and goals."],
            ["Share the measurable results of a product you designed.", 
            "In my previous role as a product designer, I worked on a product redesign project. The project focused on redesigning the product packaging for a salad dressing bottle. Originally, we expected the launch of the newly designed product to increase sales by 13%. However, within one month of its launch, sales for the company increased by 30%."],
            ["How might you rate your user experience and interaction design skill level?", 
            "I have advanced user experience skills because of my extensive work with usability testing. However, my user interaction skills are intermediate because I have fewer experiences coding and building digital interactions into applications."]

    "Data Scientist": {
        "question": [
            ["Tell me a time you had to explain something technical to a non-technical stakeholder.",
            "In a previous job, I was asked to recommend predictive models the company could use for credit-risk analysis. I created a presentation looking at the three most common types. Using visualizations, I was able to design approachable models of the science and math behind random forest, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision trees. For each visualization, I outlined the benefits and potential risks, and ultimately recommended k-nearest neighbor as the most appropriate predictive model for the analysis."],
            ["Tell me about a time you used data to influence a decision or solve a problem.",
            "I was working at a healthcare company. Our goal was to improve user acquisition, and one strategy we tested was adding a “Subscribe to Our Newsletter” button in the footer of blog posts. After rolling the feature out, the number of subscribers wasn’t growing. My job was to understand why the feature wasn’t working. Diving into the analytics, I found that the page scroll depth was just 50-75% for most of our content. Additionally, the average session duration was just 2-3 minutes. I made recommendations to the content marketing team to shorten articles so they were fully read and to move the opt-in higher on the page. After these changes, the opt-in rate increased by 50%."],
            ["How comfortable are you presenting your insights?",
            "I am mostly comfortable with it. But in large group settings it’s more difficult. For me, preparation is critical. First, I gather information about the audience and what their goals are. Then, I develop slides and a loose speaking script for the presentation. Lastly, I like to run through the presentation with colleagues once or twice for clarity and relevance."],
            ["How have you used data to elevate the experience of a customer?",
            "In my previous job, I worked for an insurance company. I helped to build a predictive model that accurately identified when a customer was experiencing difficulties. Using this model, the customer success team could reach out and resolve these issues as they were arising, not just after the customer was deeply frustrated already. The project helped reduce customer churn by 8%."],
            ["Provide an example of a goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it.",
            "I had struggled with data science presentations, and my goal was to improve and get better. There were two ways I achieved this: I enrolled in a self-paced public speaking course, and I took every opportunity to present in my last job. The most recent presentation I gave was a huge success, and helped our team secure buy-in for a new data science initiative."],
            ["How would you convince your colleagues of your approach?",
            "n a previous data science role, the company had been using a Naive Bayesian model to perform matching. I suggested that an elastic search model might perform better. At first, the team wasn’t open to testing a new approach. However, I created a short presentation on how we could implement and A/B test the elastic search model quickly. After running the A/B test, the elastic model was the clear winner, and we were able to scale up the approach to eventually supplant the original Bayesian approach."],
            ["Tell me a time when your role in a project was unclear. What did you do?",
            "I joined a start-up as a data scientist, but the role wasn’t clearly defined. The company empowered me to define the objectives of the role by myself. Because the day-to-day responsibilities weren’t yet assigned, I knew it would be best to align my work to the company’s core objectives, which were to grow user engagement by X%, improve marketing performance, and reduce customer churn. I developed a plan with milestones to make incremental quarterly progress towards those goals using data science techniques and communicated the objectives to my manager for feedback and approval. My manager agreed that the work and role was aligned with company objectives and continued to give me new leeway in tackling emerging issues and tasks."],
            ["Tell me a time when you disagreed with a project direction. What did you do?",
            "One time, I disagreed with my manager over the process for building a dashboard, as their approach was to jump straight into the execution. I knew that it would be better to perform some planning in advance, rather than feeling our way through and reacting to roadblocks as they arose, so I documented a plan that could potentially save us time in development. That documentation and planning showed where pitfalls were likely to arise, and by solving for future issues we were able to launch the new dashboard three weeks early."],
            ["How do you balance your daily responsibilities with a prioritized project?",
            "I create a schedule for the week of all the tasks I have to do, based on highest to lowest priority. I also schedule a list for each day, while providing space for ad hoc projects or to work ahead. One time, I had to deliver code for an assignment by the end of the week, but I felt that the code needed an additional five hours to be fully optimized. Each day, I left one hour free to perform code optimization, which helped to improve our final output."],
            ["Tell me about a time you failed. What did you learn from it?",
            " had to give a presentation to stakeholders about a recent data science project. However, I didn’t make the presentation accessible to the audience. As I was presenting, I could tell that I was losing the audience, so I abandoned the script and skipped ahead to the visualizations, findings and recommendations sections, and I was able to win some of them back. However, the presentation would have been much stronger had I spent more time preparing and aligning my material to my audience. I made sure to incorporate more visuals and outcomes into my future presentations to these stakeholders."],
            ["Provide an example of a goal you did not meet and how you handled it.",
            "In my last position at an e-commerce company, I was given a goal of developing a system to predict customers who were most likely to churn, which the company could then use to send personalized promotions to head off those customers. The goal was to increase customer retention by 20% and revenue by 10% over one year. Unfortunately, I missed that goal, with retention only increasing by 10% during the desired timeframe. I wanted to understand what went wrong, so I focused on improving and optimizing the prediction algorithm while also working with the marketing team to better personalize the offers."],
            ["Tell me about a time that you got unexpected results?",
            "n a previous role, I was required to build a recommendation engine to better match products to customers. I felt I had chosen the right algorithm that would lead to better matching and an increase in sales. However, while A/B testing the new recommendation engine, we couldn’t find a statistically significant difference between the new model and the existing one. While disappointing, I took those results and tweaked my assumptions on how to better match products and customers in our next round of recommendation engine testing."],
            ["Have you gone above and beyond the call of duty? If so, how?",
            "For me, going ‘above and beyond the call of duty’ is really about going all out to get a job done properly. For example, I once worked on a large team project where I could tell that one of my colleagues was struggling with his tasks. To some extent, my work was dependent on his, and it’s probable that had he delivered late, I may have been forced to as well. I approached him discreetly over lunch and offered to stay late and help him out. He couldn’t thank me enough. We worked through the night and in the end, he was able to deliver on time, and so was I."],
            ["Tell me about a time when you resolved a conflict.",
            " was working as a project manager on an IT project, and one technician was constantly late finishing tasks. When I approached him about it, he reacted defensively. I kept calm and acknowledged that the deadlines were challenging and asked how I could assist him in improving his performance. He calmed down and told me that he was involved in another project where he had to do tasks that were not in his job description. After a meeting with the other project manager, we came to a resolution that alleviated the technician’s workload. For the remainder of the project, the technician delivered great work."],
            ["Tell me a data professional you have worked with whom you really admired.",
            "The data science manager at my previous company has had a lasting impact on my career. He has such a deep understanding of data science, machine learning and statistical analysis, but is always looking for opportunities to share and impart that wisdom on others. By providing this knowledge and tools, he inspires innovative results and constant growth from his team."],
            ["What makes you best for the role?",
            "I have the exact mix of machine learning and Python skills you are looking for. However, beyond my technical skills, I excel at collaborating cross-functionally, which I know will help me jump right in and start delivering on Day 1. Most importantly, this company cares deeply about innovation, and that is what I find most exciting about this role. I am always looking for chances to experiment, grow my skills and find new ways to apply data science to business objectives."]

I personally like Software Engineers who have strong experience in either C++ or Java and can write scripts in Groovy, Perl, or Python."],
            ["How do you ensure that your code can handle different kinds of errors?",
            "I write tests that describe the expected error situations and check to see that they are handled appropriately. If the software is legacy and prone to generating exceptions, I’ll wrap it up to report the exceptions to get an idea of what needs attention first, and start attacking it there. Of course where required, we’ll use try/catch. Mostly I try to follow the rigorous WOMM development process."],
            ["What is your process to test and find bugs in an application?",
            "Software testing is not a unique approach, but it is a set of tests and assessments that can be conducted at different stages. In fact, testing should be carried out at all stages of development, including after your main launch. Things change, platforms are updated, and errors in mobile apps that were not visible earlier can suddenly appear and wreak havoc… Usually, this means viewing the application as a whole and setting priorities in any areas that you think are more at risk than others. Tests are then performed to either prove or disprove the functionality, and the detected defects are subsequently recorded. These defects can then be prioritized depending on their impact and severity."],

Teams can split work sensibly and increase overall productivity. Examples are: reset.css: reset and normalization styles; minimal color, border, or font-related declarations \ typography.css: font faces, weights, line heights, sizes, and styles for headings and body text \ layouts.css: styles that manage page layouts and segments, including grids \ forms.css: styles for form controls and labels \ lists.css: list-specific styles \ tables.css: table-specific styles \ carousel.css: styles required for carousel components \ accordion.css: styles for accordion components.”"],
            ["Tell me about a tough software development problem and how you solved it.",
            "I recently worked on a project that had some very specific security requirements the application had to follow. At a high level, we had to build a server that could function as a reverse proxy and a forward proxy and allow us to add in custom logic during the TLS handshake. My first obstacle was trying to find an off-the-shelf product that we could use for this. We have normally used NGINX for all of our proxying and load balancing throughout the system, however, NGINX did not support a way for us to add in a custom hook to the TLS logic. We looked into other OTS tools like Apache HTTP Server and HAProxy, but nothing supported what we needed out of the box. Eventually, I found that Node.js has a TLS module that provided exactly what we needed. The TLS module allowed us to easily add in custom code during the TLS handshake, and it contained a very lightweight, easy to set up HTTP proxy server. This was my first time developing a production application from the ground up in Node.js. Going from mainly Java development to Node.js provided a bit of a challenge due to the asynchronous behavior of Node.js. The custom logic we were writing required us to make an HTTP request during the TLS handshake, however in Node.js this request is asynchronous, and I realized that I wasn’t able to wait for the response before the TLS handshake was completed. Eventually, I found a way to overcome this by not putting the HTTP request into the TLS logic. Since we were caching the request, I made the request at the startup of the server, cached it, and then set a timeout function to make the request again after the value expired. That way we avoided making an async request in the TLS handshake and we just grabbed the value from the cache. The project ended up being a huge success and passed all the requirements. These security requirements were not only within our program, but other programs being built for the customer as well. We actually had other programs within the company reach out to us for the server that I had built so they could integrate it with their system as well which saved the company weeks of development time in other programs."],
            ["Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a coworker and what you did.",
            "I’ll tell you a situation in which I had a disagreement with my engineering lead. The team I was on never adopted a good branching strategy. We were constantly dealing with issues where we would have half-baked features mixed with other features that were ready to go, and we would have to cherry-pick the certain commits we wanted to take into the next build. This took up a lot of time. My manager put together a new branching strategy and presented it to us as the new path we would follow. The others on the call seemed fine with it, however, I did see a flaw in the strategy, and I spoke up about it. My manager saw the flaw as well but thought that it was still better than what we are currently doing and we should present this to the rest of the team to use for now since we have a lot of other important tasks to accomplish. I said that I didn’t think it was a good idea to have the team start adopting a new branching strategy that we already know has a flaw and will need updating again soon. Although I understood the priority to finish our other tasks first, I offered to come up with a solution that fixes the issue here and put together some slides without impacting my other milestones. He agreed and we set up a meeting for the next day to go over my design. I spent some time putting together the branching strategy, which was a more common GIT branching strategy that is used in the industry, and presented it to him and the other leads the next day. Everyone agreed on the new strategy and my manager thanked me for speaking up and putting this together in such a short time. Since this new strategy has been adopted, our team has cut down significant time on dealing with version control issues. Overall, when I deal with disagreements, I really try to ensure that everyone understands both points of view and why each person came to the decision they did. I find that normally once you dig deep into both sides, we can usually come to an agreement. However, if that’s not the case and each person is still adamant about their decision, I like to get other engineers involved and get their input on it."],

I have been working with React and Node.js in my side project and I have really fallen in love with the entire JavaScript ecosystem, so I really want to steer my career more to that tech stack. I also want to continue working with cloud services and saw that the team is using AWS which excited me as well. Aside from the technical side of things, I looked more into the company culture and saw that you really value creating an environment in which engineers can learn and continue to grow. Continuous growth is really important to me, and I want the next company I join to share that importance as well. Finally, the product itself looks amazing and seems to have the ability to impact people across the world. I would love to be part of that initiative."],

I noticed that your company is using AWS and that is a technology that I have been wanting to get some experience in. Cloud platforms in general are something I am excited to work with. This kind of leads into my next reason, which is that I am looking for more challenging work. As I mentioned I feel that I am not learning as much as I want to be, and the work that I have been doing lately hasn’t really provided any new challenges.

            "I would say my biggest weakness is public speaking. Sometimes I have trouble speaking in front of other people and I get extremely nervous speaking in a large group. When I was younger, I used to try to avoid situations in which I would have to speak in a group any way I could, however as I got into college I started to realize that I need to face this fear instead of running from it. As I’ve grown in my career, I have become a lot more comfortable with speaking in groups. I present in a lot of different meetings now daily like design reviews or demos to the customer, so I’ve gotten a lot of experience speaking in front of groups and leading discussions with a lot of attendees. While I still get nervous speaking in front of large groups, I’ve grown more accustomed to it and realize that those nerves go away as I start getting into the meeting and am comfortable with what I am presenting."],

            "I feel that constructive feedback from your peers is one of the best ways for an engineer to grow. I also feel that an important part of giving, or receiving feedback, is to give or ask for steps the engineer or you can take to improve. An example that comes to mind when I gave feedback to someone was with a software engineer that is on my current team. I noticed that quite often in our group meetings, this engineer would jump into the conversation to give their thoughts and opinions, however, it felt like they didn’t really prepare their thoughts on what they were trying to say. They would seemingly start to ramble a bit and appear to get lost in their own thoughts trying to figure out what they’re trying to say. Our company has semi-yearly performance reviews; however, I believe in giving feedback right away when I see something that I feel my colleague could improve on. So, one day I spoke with them and told them what I noticed, and they even agreed with what I had to say and said they noticed it themselves too, but they weren’t aware that it was obvious to others. I offered some advice in that they shouldn’t feel like they need to rush in order to get their points into the conversation. We’re all one team and we want to make sure everyone has an opportunity to speak up and agree on decisions we make as a team. They told me that they really appreciated me talking to them about this so that they have the opportunity to improve themselves. Since that conversation, I noticed a continuous improvement in their ability to engage in conversations at the right time and be able to get their points across to the team efficiently."],

I graduated from <school-name> in 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I put myself through college working as a waiter for a while and also working as a Java Consultant for the university. As a Java Consultant, I would help students with their course work and help them understand Java concepts and best coding practices. The summer before my senior year I replaced my job as a waiter with an internship at <company-name> which was an amazing experience for me. Over that summer I built a new time tracking application from the ground up using Java and the Spring framework that ended up replacing the current system used by the organization. My success at the internship led them to keep me on part-time while I finished up my senior year. After college, I was recruited by <company-name>and was brought on as a level one software engineer. The team I was brought onto is responsible for the security, deployment, and the monitoring and control interface for the system. After about a year I became the technical lead of the team I was on. I actually became the lead at a critical time, as the program I was on was in danger of being shut down. Since that time, however, we were able to recover the schedule, fix all the critical requirement failures and get the program back on track for a successful operation deployment. This success restored faith in the team and secured future business with the customer. Outside of work I’m currently working on a side project that I intend to finish and deploy to the web and app store this year using Node.js, React and React Native. I also just recently got into writing articles on Medium and have written a few articles on software development tips that have been published.

I put together the design and met with the systems engineering team and my lead to present the design, and everyone agreed to go forward with it. However, once I presented the design to the customer, they pointed out some flaws in the design and we realized there was a misunderstanding of the requirements. The big issue was that we had already used up all of the time that was estimated for the design task, so we were in danger of getting behind schedule with the development. To remedy the situation, I ended up working some overtime hours to put together a new design that would meet the requirements and resolve the issues pointed out by the customer. I was able to quickly put together a new design over the weekend and present it to the customer the following week. The new design was approved, and we were able to get started on the development work on schedule. I learned a valuable lesson here in that I should have gotten the customer involved in the design early on and iteratively as needed. If I had done that in this situation, I would have been able to catch the issues earlier and not at the last minute, which led me to overwork myself that week."],

The Customer Care Manager was new to the company and was pretty insistent on this solution as she had used this solution in her earlier organization and it worked pretty effectively to troubleshoot customer issues. In order to convince her that User impersonation wasn’t the right solution as we were dealing with sensitive PHI information, used the 5 Why technique to understand the real need/premise of where she was coming from. Then worked with Customer Care advocates to get details about the use cases where they would need to mimic the user behavior. Once I had this information, engaged with engineering team to brainstorm solutions and options around providing customer care advocates ability to debug difficult to issues and also meets the security and compliance requirements. Working with engineering team, proposed a solution that include 1) co-browsing solution, along with dashboard restricting PHI data to what they need and logging and tracing tool) that would aid in expediting issue resolution in difficult to repro. Also, involved Compliance team and got their buy-in as well. Then I validated the approach with the customer care advocates, then scheduled a meeting with Customer Care Manager, and presented these options weighing in the pros as compared to the solution suggested. The customer care manager was convinced about this approach.

The second option was to fully automate the end to end process that would take 4 weeks of development, but fully automate the process and that could be rolled out across the board. The process was to change the member's paperless preference to paper when a sent email gets bounced 3 times in a row and inform her with a paper notice. Now, the whole process is manual, including bounced back members email Ids extraction from through reporting tool, track those members back, change the paperless preference, and create a notice with given verbiage. This is a weekly process and full-day work for an operation guy. I received a request to automate this process on priority because the operations team is resource-constrained and they couldn't afford a day spent every week on a single process. After having detailed requirements, I had a product discovery session with the lead developers and operations manager. Followed by efforts vs impact analysis(ROI), Option 1 - Short term solution was to automate the sending notice part of a process that involved less effort and will take a week of development time. Option 2 - a long-term solution was to fully automate the process that involved medium level efforts and will take 4 weeks of development efforts with high impact and scalability. Option 2 with high ROI was the winner because that would solve end to end problem, besides that, I had to make sure that it would fulfill the operations team objective and got a go-ahead from them.

This mistake taught me the importance of focusing and monitoring non functional requirements as well in addition to new feature development /adoption where I was mostly spending my time on. After deploying the quick fix, I ensured that such a mistake doesn’t get repeated by putting a good application management tool in place and set up to receive email alerts and necessary Pagerduty alerts when website behavior exceeds set thresholds/SLAs. I personally took the effort to also learn the tool myself to further analyze past issues and call out optimization areas to engineering.

So, we do not receive customer query logs which impacts data usage knowledge + customer service improvement aspects. So I discussed the pain points with the partners to identify an internal work around. We discussed that the team could start by sharing an automated delivery of daily query count numbers. I created a graphical analysis and held coordinated discussions with the data analysis teams to understand low counts on certain weeks and understand domain impacts for high usage weeks.

    "UX Designer": {
        "question": [
            ["Describe your design process and what methods you follow.",
            "UX design is constantly evolving and searching for new ways to solve problems. Seasoned UX designers have likely been evolving their own approach to the design process and will vary from one designer to another. In general, good UX designers with walk you through a certain process or ‘toolkit’ they follow when approaching a problem or project. This will likely be a set of steps they will take to solve user problems and create engaging experiences. Listen for both a clear process…. and specific steps they take to solve user problems and create engaging experiences. Listen for both a clear process, a deep curiosity and a constant desire to learn. One overarching theme should be around a user-centric approach to design and perhaps mention ‘design-thinking,’ which follows a thorough understanding of both user and business goals. In general, this is often an iterative design process that is constantly evolving. Key concepts or methods used to carry out this process may include, but is not limited to:: competitive audits, stakeholder interviews, user research involving interviews and surveys, content audits, information architecture, user personas, business model canvases, mood boards, storyboards, empathy maps, use case scenarios and user flows, customer journeys, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. They may also mention conducting user-testing—moderated or unmoderated, remote or in person—multivariate testing, eye tracking, click-tracking heatmaps and other quantitative analytics. Apart from the above, listen for UX design techniques such as observing interaction design standards, best practices, conventions, and rules-of-thumb known as ‘heuristics.’ By applying these UX methodologies and learning directly from users, each of the techniques mentioned above can play an important role in the creation of a product that users will love."],
            ["Describe a recent project you were particularly challenged by.",
            "This question should help you understand more about a UX designer’s process. What did they find challenging and why? How did they set out to come up with a solution? While there is no right or wrong way to approach a particular challenge, having a clear strategy to facilitate an end goal is essential. For example—on an existing product—did they gather extra user-generated data to help them crystallize a problem? This could mean collecting data using analytics, or might involve testing the design on a specific demographic in a format that makes the most sense. This could include testing wireframes or interactive prototypes on users to either validate or reject hypotheses; or it could be sending a survey to a wider demographic to better understand product market fit. Did they, for example, employ remote moderated user-testing, or some kind of remote research methodology in order to listen to users and arrive at better design solutions? Potentially, a UX designer may start multivariate testing and let data lead the way until they hit a roadblock, then continue iterating until they achieve a satisfactory result. UX designers thrive on solving challenges, so a good candidate should readily share enthusiasm about how they approach problems."],
            ["What are some biggest challenges you face as a UX designer?",
            "One attribute of a great designer is the ability to evaluate their work objectively. No matter what stage of their career, there will always be those challenges that every designer strives to overcome in a meaningful way. Listen for answers that not only describe the challenges they may face, but how they overcome them. They may have a challenge justifying their design process to certain stakeholders—it may seem too costly and take too long. How do they overcome these obstacles? For example—convincing a company they need more in depth user research before a product is designed, or incorporating proper usability testing during a product design lifecycle can be difficult. How do they advocate for the aforementioned in making their case? Another challenge may be conducting user research in innovative ways. This can prove to be especially difficult for designers who work remotely, because direct access to their end users is limited. Gathering, analyzing and translating both qualitative and quantitative user data into ‘actionable insights’ may pose another challenge. However, good designers have a method of focusing on the most impactful elements and teasing out the biggest return on investment. Listen for answers that include overcoming challenges of working with others with different agendas. A UX designer will always face challenges around collaborating with professionals from other disciplines, such as C-level executives, product managers, engineers and visual designers."],
            ["What does the term ‘design-thinking’ mean to you?",
            "Listen for the UX designer to describe it as a user-centered design approach, a process. As  Tim Brown, president, and CEO of IDEO, a famed global design consultancy describes it: “‘Design thinking’ is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.” Design thinking is a method for the generation of solutions and a practical, creative resolution of problems. It’s about uncovering insights into the unmet needs of your target audience. It’s a form of solution-based, or solution-focused thinking, with the intent of producing a constructive future result. Most of all it’s a ‘people first’ approach—a design process mindset that designs products around people’s needs, motivations, and behaviors."],

A good UX designer will help you design products that work well across a variety of use cases—from mobile to desktop, as well as a wide variety of audiences. A UX designer should be able to elaborate on how they think of, and engage user research. What ‘lenses’ do they use when conducting user research? These ‘lenses’ could be ethnographic studies, field studies and contextual observations, focus groups, surveys and diary studies. They should mention details of how they set goals for the research and came up with a research plan. How they approached the organizational aspect, the recruiting of representative users—what kind of research questions they asked and how they analyzed the results. While there is more than one approach to facilitating user research, the designer should have a clear description of the method, the sample size required to gain a meaningful result, and speak to the interpretation of the data. Look for a UX designer who understands how to measure appropriately by selecting the minimum number of subjects needed to gain a valid understanding of the research, and comprehends what they are testing and seeking to understand. For usability testing the designer should discuss the methodologies they used. Did they conduct structured one-on-one interviews with users while they tried specific tasks with product prototypes? Listen for how they’d define a successful test, i.e. what key revelations were gathered and how was the data distilled into practical, actionable insights? Did they use moderated or unmoderated usability testing? (Unmoderated testing examples may include eye tracking, click tracking heatmaps, online card sorting exercises, etc.)"],
            ["What are some trends in the UX Design industry right now?",
            "Listen for passion and knowledge. A good designer is going to be excited about this topic; the answer will help you understand where their current focus lies. Also, listen for how a UX designer keeps up with the industry—such as following UX podcasts, reading UX blogs and books, attending webinars and online training courses for ongoing learning, etc. A UX designer who thinks ahead will be an invaluable asset to your company. He may talk about new use cases beyond screens—or how designing for accessibility is an area of interest for him. He may discuss new prototyping tools that save developers and designers time by converting the design to code, or he may simply explain an evolving trend and how terrific it is to be at the forefront of technology. Whatever his answer, passion should shine through. Most of all, it’s not about technology, it’s about solving problems for users in new and efficient ways. Ultimately, it’s not about ‘design fads.’ A great UX designer doesn’t follow them but designs products that have staying power and simply work well for end users."],
            ["What is your approach to making websites / platforms accessible?",
            "Accessibility is a huge topic for UX designers, especially as screens begin to shrink and we consume and engage in content wherever we go. Designing digital products able to be used anywhere is paramount to a product’s success; when our end user has specific requirements in terms of sensory constraints, the design should facilitate interaction and be even more empathetic. Take notice if the designer is aware of, and follows the World Wide Web Consortium’s ‘Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.’ Have they performed an accessibility analysis on a previous project? With a focus on accessibility, testing becomes especially important and should be comprehensive. An app or website should be simple enough to facilitate a clear end goal or user task, and innovative approaches should be used to ensure a user with a disability can actually interact with the product. Some examples could include using voiceover commands to navigate websites and apps for people with motor disabilities, adding captions to a video which benefits people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, making content easier to read by screen readers for the blind—or designing an option to use large typography for users with vision impairment."],
            ["When a client says: “I don’t like this.” What do you do?",
            "In a situation like this, a great UX designer exhibits thoughtful restraint. They will not take critique personally, but use it as an opportunity to dig deeper and uncover the real reasons why a client may not like a design. Great UX designers are objective; they rely on tried and true principles, past learnings, white papers and studies, best practices, standards and design conventions that have been tested, studied and validated. Accordingly, they should be able to back up their designs based on the aforementioned. Typically, in these circumstances, a misalignment has occurred between what the client was looking for and what the designer was trying to achieve. A great designer would take a step back and ask smart questions to uncover the issues a client may have with the design. Is the client being subjective as in, “I don’t like that color?” The designer would inquire why, and make sure the client understands that design decisions are based on sound principles—color theory for example—and not subjective opinion. Also listen for examples of when the designer backed up design decisions based on analytics data and testing (staying objective), and how they presented facts and findings to make their case. Some client feedback may be for compelling business reasons. For example, the client may feel that an oversimplified solution misses valuable opportunities for revenue-generating ad placement. A good designer would listen patiently and incorporate the feedback into the next iteration, understanding that arriving at the optimal design is a balancing act between business needs, technical feasibility and the designer’s desire to create the best UX."],
            ["Who are your design heroes?",
            "Every great UX designer has at least a dozen books by design legends on their bookshelf, as well as favorite app designs that they appreciate because of the quality of the UX. Listening to the reasons why they love their design heroes and favorite apps can reveal a great deal about a designer’s everyday approach to UX—their ‘design thinking,’ sensibility and taste, and will speak volumes about what kind of UX designer they are. It’s more important to listen for the ‘why’ than give credence to names or which design guru it is. Nevertheless, here are a few to take note of: Dieter Rams (German industrial designer at Braun), Steve Jobs and Jonathan Ive (Apple), Don Norman (best known for his books on design, especially The Design of Everyday Things), Steve Krug and Alan Cooper. This also applies to their favorite apps. Again, it’s the ‘why’ that’s important—listen closely for what in the UX design makes these their favorites. For example: Uber, Instagram, Snapseed, Spotify, Facebook, and Netflix."],
            ["Give a design example set out to solve a business problem.",
            "Using an example project, a great UX designer would demonstrate the understanding that they’re not just designing a new interface, website or app, but also a way to solve a business problem. First, they would talk about the discovery/problem definition phase where they carried out comprehensive research to uncover insights into the source of the problem. Next, they would have researched users from the target demographic and identified common themes, unmet user needs and where the business may have fallen short overall. They would demonstrate their skill at evaluating the goals of the business, the use case scenarios and how to best align them in order to find a solution. Lastly, they would have reached into their UX toolkit and used prototypes (among other things) to explore potential solutions and validate ideas and hypotheses focused on obtaining significant business value from the solutions achieved by an optimal UX design."],
            ["What analytics tools and KPIs have you used to evaluate your designs?",
            "Great UX designers seek to create experiences that will intuitively work for a specific target audience. Garnering quantitative data on site usage or an application plays an important role in a UX designer’s arsenal of UX success evaluation tools. Whereas user research typically focuses on qualitative data, analytics focus on quantitative data, such as identifying what actions users take when they come to a page. There are many analytics tools and methods available that capture user behavior; e.g. eye tracking, click tracking heatmaps and ‘UI tagging’ that tracks specific elements with which users interact on a page. Don’t focus on the software tool—listen for the why, the methods they used and what measurements they took. What key performance indicators (KPIs) were they evaluating against? For example, how many users moved through the onboarding process quickly or clicked on that sign-up button—how many set up 1-click ordering?"],

            "UX-driven product design isn’t just about creating a great user experience, it’s also a smart business move. A great UX designer makes the case for usability—for designing great user experiences that work for people, as well as contributing to the bottom line. They may illustrate why so many projects fail and have to be redone, and how that costs an enormous amount of money. Or outline why investing in UX is a no-brainer if a product is to succeed in the marketplace. Or mention hard data from statistical findings and use examples such as ‘68% of users give up because they think you don’t care about them’ and ‘89% of consumers purchased from a competitor following a poor user experience’. When talking about the return of investing in UX, they should also discuss success measures by including the calculation of cost savings in relationship to your overall return. A great UX designer would discuss how investing in UX improves performance, reduces errors, increases ease of use, attracts more users, increases adoption rates, elevates the brand, increases trust in the system and user satisfaction, reduces development costs, reduces redesign costs, decreases support costs and reduces training needed, etc. which all increase the ROI."],

            ["Describe your UX research process and what methods you follow.",
            "UX research is continuously evolving and searching for new approaches to aid the product design process and solve problems. Seasoned UX researchers have likely been developing their approach to the research process, and will vary from one UX researcher to another. In general, great UX researchers will walk through the “toolkit” they use when approaching a problem or a project. Depending on resources and time given for research, listen for their flexibility with approaches. Great UX researchers have a deep curiosity and a constant desire to learn about steps they could take to solve user problems. A UX researcher will reach into their toolkit and apply the most effective research methods given the constraints within which they have to work. Listen for applying different methods of UX research depending on the project. There is primary and secondary UX research, qualitative and quantitative UX research, generative and evaluative UX research. Generative research is conducted during the beginning of the investigative process. It helps UX researchers clearly define a problem and generate a hypothesis for its solution. Evaluative research is executed near the end of the research process, and it’s used to test and refine ideas until the best solution is reached. One overarching theme should be around a human-centric approach to research; perhaps mention “design thinking,” which follows a thorough understanding of both user and business goals. Key concepts or methods used to carry out this process may include but are not limited to competitive audits, stakeholder interviews, user personas, empathy maps, user research, content audits, minimum viable product (MVP) lean UX, and usability testing. They may also mention conducting user testing—moderated or unmoderated, remote or in-person—multivariate testing, A/B testing, eye tracking, click-tracking heatmaps, and other quantitative analytics. Apart from the above, listen for UX research methodologies that will help align the product’s design with business goals and marketing, and which encompass the company’s brand promise. By applying these UX research methodologies and learning directly from users, each of the techniques mentioned above can play an essential role in the creation of a product that users will love."],
            ["What would be some current challenges UX researchers face?",
            "One attribute of a great UX researcher is the ability to evaluate their work objectively. No matter what stage of their career, there will always be those challenges that every UX researcher strives to overcome in a meaningful way. Listen for answers that not only describe the challenges they may face but how they overcome them. According to a recent study, these are the four challenges UX researchers face today: Inclusion in the product development process Sourcing the right participants for UX research Securing resources and budget Getting executive buy-in about UX research The UX researcher who’s being interviewed may not name these four above exactly, but they should voice similar challenges they face every day. Listen for the UX researcher demonstrating an understanding of the root of the problem and a willingness to overcome these challenges by various methods. Ask about how they overcame them. Listen for answers that include overcoming challenges of working with others with different agendas. A UX researcher will always face challenges around collaborating with professionals from other disciplines, such as C-level executives, marketing teams, sales teams, growth teams, product managers, engineers, and designers. They may have a challenge justifying their UX research process to specific stakeholders—it may seem too costly and take too long. How do they overcome these obstacles? How do they align their work with that of the goals of the business, the company’s brand, and marketing efforts? For example, convincing a company they need more in-depth user research before a product is designed, or incorporating proper usability testing during a product design lifecycle can be difficult. How do they advocate for those mentioned above in making their case?"],
            ["Is UX research important? Why?",
            "A great UX researcher should be passionate about the need for UX research because it’s an essential step in the human-centered UX design process. UX research guides subsequent stages in design to provide effective solutions to customer problems. It is “the soul of the product build process.” The reason why UX research is necessary is because doing user research provides insight into which features to prioritize and helps develop clarity around a project. A great UX researcher should elaborate on the importance of UX research, break it down into concrete terms, and talk about the need to: Focus on the end user and approach product design from the user’s perspective Identify the product’s potential user base and build user personas Understand users’ behavior, goals, and motivations Deep dive into specific areas to identify user needs Tease out actionable insights from UX research to help the product design process As to why it’s important to conduct UX research, listen for the following great reasons for doing UX research. To create a product that is truly relevant to users: If you don’t have a clear understanding of your users and their mental models, you have no way of knowing whether your design will be relevant. A design that is not relevant to its target audience will never be a success. To create a product that is easy and pleasurable to use: A favorite quote from Steve Jobs: “If the user is having a problem, it’s our problem.” If your user experience is not optimal, chances are that people will move on to another product. To have the return on investment (ROI) of user experience design validated and be able to show: An improvement in performance and credibility Increased exposure and sales—growth in customer base"],
            ["How do you approach UX research?",
            "Listen for answers that include a discussion around empathy—things like “walking a mile in a customer’s shoes” (customer journeys) and a human-centered, goal-driven approach to designing products. Empathizing with people often means engaging in in-depth user research to solve problems. It’s essential to ask the right questions in order to come up with reliable solutions, and to ask great questions, researchers need to be able to empathize with people and gather relevant information through in-depth UX research. Also, listen for two main types of user research, such as qualitative research and quantitative research. Qualitative research is about gathering insights and is concerned with descriptions, which can be observed but cannot be computed. Qualitative user research is a direct assessment of behavior based on observation. It’s about understanding people’s beliefs and practices on their terms. It can involve several different methods, including contextual observation, ethnographic studies, interviews, field studies, and moderated usability tests. Quantitative research is primarily exploratory research and is used to quantify the problem by way of generating numerical data or data that can be transformed into useful statistics. Some standard data collection methods include various forms of surveys (online surveys, paper surveys, mobile surveys, and kiosk surveys), longitudinal studies, website interceptors, online polls, and systematic observations. Quantitative data from analytics platforms should ideally be balanced with qualitative insights gathered from other UX testing methods, such as focus groups or usability testing. The analytical data will show patterns that may be useful for deciding what assumptions to test further. Most great UX researchers know that it’s about balance: employing the right amount of each type of research depending on the scenario. A great UX researcher doesn’t rely on one or the other exclusively. It’s about the right mix of the two. The reason why they need to do qualitative research, for example, is because the most critical information is often not quantifiable, and quantitative analysis is often too narrow to be useful and can sometimes be outright misleading."],
            ["Describe a recent challenging UX research project.",
            "This question should help you understand more about a UX researcher’s process. What kind of project was it? What did they find challenging, and why? How did they set out to come up with a solution? While there is no right or wrong way to approach a particular challenge, having a clear strategy to facilitate an end goal is essential. For example—on an existing product—they may have found it challenging to define the problem. Did they gather extra user-generated data to help them crystallize the problem? It could mean collecting data using analytics, or it might involve testing the design on a specific demographic in a format that makes the most sense. This could include testing wireframes or interactive prototypes on users to either validate or reject hypotheses, or it could be sending a survey to a broader demographic to understand product-market fit better. For example, did they employ remote moderated user testing or another form of remote research methodology to listen to users and arrive at better design solutions? Did they interface with C-level executives and company marketing and sales teams to better understand business goals, the customers, and what problem the product was trying to solve? Potentially, a UX researcher may start multivariate testing or A/B testing and let data lead the way until they hit a roadblock, then continue iterating until they achieve a satisfactory result. UX researchers thrive on solving challenges, so the right candidate should readily share enthusiasm about how they approach problems."],
            ["Provide some examples of your Human-Centered Design thinking.",
            "First and foremost, human-centered design is all about understanding your users. A good UX researcher will help design products that work well across a variety of use cases across a wide range of audiences. A seasoned UX researcher should be able to elaborate on how they think of and engage user research, which, in essence, drives human-centered design. What “lenses” do they use when conducting user research? These “lenses” could be ethnographic studies, field studies and contextual observations, focus groups, surveys, and diary studies.

Did they use moderated or unmoderated usability testing? (Unmoderated testing examples may include eye-tracking, click-tracking heatmaps, online card sorting exercises, and more.)"],
            ["How do you recruit the right UX research participants?",
            "UX researchers should spend the time necessary to identify and find the right people with whom to conduct user research. The quality of the final UX research report will be built on the quality of the feedback sources: the UX research participants. A great UX researcher will identify the user base (personas) for a given product and set out to find representative participants for UX research and user testing. They should also form relationships with gatekeepers who can provide researchers with access to end users. Listen for specific recruiting strategies based on the type of product they may be working on as well as ways to screen UX research participants to find the optimal mix. UX researchers should seek out users with varied experiences with a product. For example, seek out users who no longer use the service or are inactive. Finding out why they’ve dropped off (Have they turned to a competitor? No longer need the product? Or something else?) can lend valuable insights into how to improve the product. Customers who have spent much time complaining to support are also valuable. These people are usually invested in making the product better and will feel validated having their opinions heard. Looking at where the product is currently marketed (social media, newsletters, specific websites or blogs) can be a useful way to find the types of people the company is already targeting. Other options could include paid surveys and UX testing platforms like usertesting.com. There’s also the option of going “into the wild,” as in guerilla user research. For example, if creating a mobile app for grocery coupons, researchers could head to their local grocery store to gather feedback. The more genuine the participant, the higher-quality the results will be. In a B2B environment, UX researchers should consider how to communicate with participants most effectively and whether they need to go through gatekeepers or if they can communicate with users directly. Different companies will have different procedures for this."],
            ["What are the UX research deliverables?",
            "The work of a UX researcher happens in many different environments—from lean startups and Agile environments where teams work with little documentation to consulting engagements for third parties or large enterprises and government entities with strict documentation requirements. Regardless of the nature of the engagement or environment (and the one thing that ties it all together), UX researchers need to effectively communicate their research findings and the context of projects to a range of audiences. During a UX research process, researchers will produce a wide variety of “artifacts” and project deliverables as part of their UX research methodology. Deliverables may take many forms because they help UX researchers communicate with various stakeholders and teams. It may be documenting the UX research, delivering reports, and providing artifacts for meetings and ideation sessions. Some UX research deliverables include but are not limited to: UX research plans, Survey analysis reports, Consolidated interview analysis reports, Consolidated insights from user observation research reports, Competitor analysis reports, Affinity maps, Empathy maps, User personas, User testing plans, Usability testing reports, User analytics (geographic, demographic, device used, etc. data), Product usage analytics reports, UX research reports—that may be consolidated reports of most of the above."],
            ["How do you distill UX research into actionable insights?",
            "If conducting UX research is divergent thinking, then synthesizing is convergent. UX researchers may collect copious amounts of data, but the meaning of all that data won’t necessarily become apparent until they synthesize it. Researchers take an array of data and restructure it into a handful of insights to prioritize those insights. There isn’t one right way to do it, and they may use many different methods to synthesize UX research, including affinity maps, empathy maps, personas, problem statements, and journey maps. Generally, listen for how UX researchers go through specific steps in a well-defined process as they look for themes and patterns from which to draw practical conclusions. Through a rigorous process, the aim should be to go from findings to actionable insights which they can share with the broader product and design teams. It is a process, and each UX researcher may have their preferred method depending on the type of research they did. With each UX research method, they may employ different approaches to extract the most impactful ideas. For example, they might be distilling a user interview series with a dozen users. They would perhaps take notes, use post-its to keep track of critical insights, and identify salient points (rather than just summarizing the interview.) It’s best to listen for various types of methods they may use, the distilling process, and how they approach each UX research project a different way to find actionable insights."],
            ["What tools do you use for conducting UX research?",
            "Since UX research techniques vary, so do the tools UX researchers use. Listen for how the UX researcher describes their experience with various tools and how they use them. The UX researcher should be well-versed in an arsenal of tools and use each one appropriately, depending on the UX research project. For example, for user interviews—one-on-one sessions that can be conducted in a variety of ways—they may use video conferencing apps such as Skype, BlueJeans, or Zoom, with which they can also record the interview for future analysis. When they employ guerrilla-style interviews—where a UX researcher performs impromptu interviews with a random set of users (such as at a coffee shop)—they may use a small audio recording device. Similarly, for remote user testing, they may use video conferencing apps as mentioned above or more sophisticated online tools such as usertesting.com, UserZoom, Lookback, and Userbrain. With all of these tools, product testing sessions can be recorded, including the participant’s desktop or mobile screen and the tester’s and the participant’s face and voice. For user surveys, they may use tools such as Google Forms or SurveyMonkey, scalable, inexpensive means to collect specific information from users. They may mention generating lots of notes from contextual observations, and when distilling the collected information and constructing an affinity map, they may use sticky notes or an online tool, such as Miro or DoGo Maps. For card sorting—a generative UX research method that reveals users’ mental models by having them arrange topics into groups that make sense to them—they may use paper cards or various online tools, such as OptimalSort. For multivariate and A/B testing, they may mention Crazy Egg, Google Optimize, Optimizely, or Maxymiser. For website usage analysis, they may use widely used tools such as Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics, and for precise in-product usage metrics, they may use Mixpanel or Pendo. For eye-tracking and scroll heatmaps, session replays, and conversion funnels, they may be familiar with Hotjar, Crazy Egg, Inspectlet, Clicktale, or EyeQuant."],

That’s a lot to pack in! You’ll want to paint with fairly broad strokes without being vague. Here’s what NOT to say: “Well, I figure out what the objectives are and then decide what methods are best and then get to work.” And here are some templates to get you started on the right foot: My first priority going into a project is to… After that, I need to… Depending on what I find out, I’ll either…or… When that’s done, I move on to…"],
