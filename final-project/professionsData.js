            ["Can you tell me a little about yourself?",
                "I'm a product designer based in San Franscisco. I've spent the last 3 years working with the wonderful design team Square, where I've been mainly focused on building out a consistent and scalable design system for their growing team. Prior to that, I spent 2 years with Coda as a user researcher and UI designer. I really enjoyed the visual design and interaction design aspects of this role. I actually have a background in architecture and hold a Masters of Architecture from the University of Melbourne. I've always been passionate about design and became fascinated with product design and UX back in 2015 because of its focus on data and user research to make the best design decisions and user experience. I found this data-led design process fascinating. I spent a year learning all I can about the product design process in my spare time before transitioning into the industry."], 
            ["What is your design process?", 
                "Of course, this depends largely on the project, timeframe, and requirements, but my ideal design process is as follows. I like to think about the product design process as problem-solving. The first step of this process is to understand the problem through research: user research, stakeholder interviews, competitive audits, user personas, market research... The goal here is to develop a deep understanding of what the problem is, what the business goals are, and what success looks like. I like to establish clear KPIs and success metrics at this point. I also like to involve the engineering team and other stakeholders in the design process as early as possible. This helps me better understand constraints or other perspectives that are invaluable and help prevent roadblocks down the track! Once I have a well-rounded understanding of everything, I'll begin wireframing and prototyping potential solutions. This is a highly interactive process. If the project and timeframe allow, it's always a good idea to conduct some usability testing at this point where I like to conduct further user research with interactive Figma prototypes to highlight areas of improvement. When the development process starts, I'll continue to work closely with the engineering team to make sure they have everything they need (mockups, user flows etc.). Finally, once the design is live, I'll keep a close eye on both quantitative and quantitative data and compare it against the KPIs I set at the start of the project. This helps identify areas we can improve further. Usually, this involves ongoing usability testing and A/B testing so we can further iterate and improve the user experience."],
            ["What type of work or part of the design process do you enjoy the most?", 
                "I gravitate much more towards the prototyping and UI design stage of the design process. Building complex user flows and iterating on them are where my strengths are and I really enjoy using Figma and Principle. That being said, I understand that this is just a small part of the design process so I try not to neglect the research and testing parts of the process!"],
            ["What type of work or part of the design process do you not enjoy doing?", 
            "Numbers and analyzing large data sets are something that I've had a bit of trouble with in the past. When I worked for Doordash, I conducted some large-scale usability testing which involved a lot of data. The goal was to quantify areas we can improve in the iOS app sign-up process and begin working on some improved designs. At the time, I hadn't had much experience with working with data sets of that size and found it challenging. With the help of an online course from Udemy, I was able to work my way through it and uncover some useful insights. We made improvements based on these insights and saw a 10% decrease in sign-up dropoffs over the next month! This is still the part of the UX process I find challenging, so I've been continuing with Udemy courses in my spare time to improve since then."],
            ["What is the difference between product design and UX design or UI design?", 
            "I like to think of product design as the entire process that involves UX, UI and other aspects of the design process. UX design is focused on investigating behavioral patterns and exploring how to improve the user experience, while UI design is focused on implementing these learnings into a user interface and experience. Product design is both of these processes and more. As a product designer, my focus is on the entire user experience holistically. This includes constantly making improvements to the current user experience, even if I didn't design it. A great product designer should be able to handle the entire design process end-to-end, and then continue to iterate on the final product over time to improve it."],
            ["How do you know if you've made the correct design decision?", 
            "Data, mainly! When working on a new feature or product, it's just as important to test ideas before they're built as it is to test them after. While common sense and even a bit of intuition are useful, the key part of the design process is data and user testing which should inform decisions. When I was a product designer at Coinbase, we weren't sure how to layout a table on mobile. This was a central part of the product and everyone had a different opinion on how it should be done. After we had a few prototypes ready in Figma, we conducted some usability testing with Maze and collected qualitative and quantitative data on which our users performed. There was a clear preference for the new table layout. This was just a small sample size and an interactive prototype, but enough validation that we were on the right track. After it was built and live on the site, we defined some key metrics to monitor and set up some larger usability tests to make sure it was the right decision. The result was that the majority of users preferred the new design. Our analytics showed that more users were interacting with the table on mobile as well. Of course, we expected this, but we couldn't have been sure it was the correct design decision until we'd thoroughly tested the idea."],
            ["How do you handle design criticism?", 
            "I like to leave my ego out of the room when it comes to product design; I think great product designers are objective and should rely on data. Once you get emotional about a design decision or criticism it just complicates things and makes everyone's job harder. This leads to a worse-off user experience in the long run. If I'm presenting ideas or prototypes and they're met with design criticism I always handle it professionally and patiently. I think it's best to make design decisions based on data and user testing to keep things objective so that's often the best approach — I can then incorporate this feedback into the next iteration. If the criticism is subjective (e.g. I do not like that color), I like to understand why they don't like it and whether there are other options we can look at that don't sacrifice contrast and usability or other important details. Of course, there always needs to be room for compromise if necessary. This can be a balancing act between understanding the business goals, time and resource constraints, and what the user testing and data shows. At the end of the day, as long as I can keep everyone happy and make the best design decisions possible with the information available I am happy."],
            ["Do you have any experience with design systems?", 
            "Yes — I helped build and maintain the Figma design system at Wealthsimple. We used Storybook to keep everything consistent and up-to-date which made our frontend developers' lives much easier! I think consistency and scalability are important, especially at the start of new products. Without a proper design system to work from and build upon, maintaining consistent designs and remembering design decisions just becomes a mess. Over time, this builds expensive technical debt that will eventually have to be sorted out."],
            ["Why do you want this product design job?", 
            "Stripe has a fantastic reputation. I have a few former colleagues working here, and I've seen how much Stripe's mission to increase the GDP of the Internet bleeds into everything you do. I helped Bolt design its one-click checkout, and I believe I could contribute significantly to the design and improvement of Stripe Checkout."],
            ["Do you have a project that you're most proud of?", 
            "When I was a UX designer at Stash, I worked on the new onboarding process. This was my first project at Stash that I handled on my own end-to-end. I had one main goal: to improve the signup conversion rate which had been hovering at 30-32% for the last two quarters. I researched dozens of similar experiences and best practices, spoke to existing users, designed new experiences in Figma, and even built working prototypes in Webflow before conducting a series of user tests to make the best design decisions. Once the new onboarding was live, I tracked conversions and we saw a significant uptick. The conversion rate increased to 45% and I used Hotjar to make incremental improvements for the following quarter. After 3 months, the conversion rate was 56%."],
            ["Have you had any projects that didn't go well? What would you have done differently?", 
            "Absolutely! In 2020, I was working on a small design team at Customer.io. We were working on improving the text editor as it was outdated and users were experiencing some formatting issues in certain browsers. The goal was to update the design of the text editor to match our new design as well as fix these formatting issues. It was my responsibility to prototye a new design in Figma. We presented the new design to our product manager and she loved it. However, once it was implemented, we spoke to some of our users and they were frustrated that the formatting panel was fixed to the top of the text box. This became an issue when you are working with a lot of text because you have to scroll back up. We didn't foresee this problem during the design process. To fix this, we had to work quickly and implement a fix to make this formating panel sticky for longer text boxes. As part of the design process, we spent a lot of time looking at what competitors and great companies were doing. However, these solutions weren't working with large bodies of text like some of our customers were. If I was to do this project over again, I would have more carefully thought through these fringe cases and conducted some usability testing with a working prototype. This would have undoubtedly uncovered this problem before it was pushed live."],
            ["What is your favorite product?", 
            "My favorite product is the Robinhood platform. It's an investment app that allows you to buy shares and options. I started using this app initially for its features as it allows you to purchase fractional shares which are partial amounts of shares. Both the design and UX of the app have won me over since then. I've used a bunch of brokerage platforms in the past, but Robinhood has really stepped up from a product design perspective. One thing they do really great is that the app is designed intuitively on both desktop and mobile. Most alternatives I explored neglected the desktop experience. It's incredibly easy to navigate and search. The team behind the app creates some really great educational content mainly aimed at helping new investors get comfortable with investing. The difference between Robinhood and other investing apps is that all of this great content and info is accessible right in the app. It's always encouraging me to explore new companies and learn about them. I've seen firsthand how well their UX works at keeping me engaged. So much so that I'm constantly referring to it as I tackle similar design challenges. One thing I think that lets the Robinhood user experience down is their onboarding. It's very long because financial services apps need a lot of information for risk and compliance reasons, however, there's no indication of how far along in the process you are. As a result, it's tempting to drop out and finish it later but you cannot dave your progress. This is one of the first things I'd fix if I was working on this product to avoid potential customers dropping out of the signup process."],
            ["How do you use user personas?", 
            "I use my user personas throughout the entire product design process, especially at the beginning and end of each step. I found this strategy to be useful in my previous product design position because it allowed me to make sure the product was addressing consumer needs at all production points. For example, I was designing a carpet cleaner and designed the product with a built-in brush on the bottle to allow consumers to remove stains using only the bottle. I did this because a consumer challenge I found in my initial persona research was that consumers weren't able to get to stains fast enough with the number of materials they needed to grab."],
            ["How do you approach making user personas?", 
            "When making user personas, I usually begin by gathering consumer data to understand who the product's target audiences are. To find this information, I search through the internal data my company has, as well as external consumer data online. Once I have this insight, I develop between four and six personas to represent different target audience groups. In each of them, I try to highlight information like demographic, personality, preferred channels and goals."],
            ["Share the measurable results of a product you designed.", 
            "In my previous role as a product designer, I worked on a product redesign project. The project focused on redesigning the product packaging for a salad dressing bottle. Originally, we expected the launch of the newly designed product to increase sales by 13%. However, within one month of its launch, sales for the company increased by 30%."],
            ["How might you rate your user experience and interaction design skill level?", 
            "I have advanced user experience skills because of my extensive work with usability testing. However, my user interaction skills are intermediate because I have fewer experiences coding and building digital interactions into applications."],
